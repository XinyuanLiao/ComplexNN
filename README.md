# ComplexNN
Since subsequent versions of PyTorch support matrix operations and gradient descent on complex parameters, this repository provides the latest complex form of some standard Pytorch network modules.

# Module
The main complex form modules included are
* complexLinear
* complexRNNcell
* complexActivation
